CNN on Oral Cancer Holistic Images 

1.	Augmented tge data with flip and rotate.

2.	Segmented the data into mormal and cancerous.

3.	Added cnn and fc layer with images.

4.	Created a [cnn-pool-cnn-pool-fc-softmax] architecture and got 67% accuracy (overfitting?)

5.	Currently trying to accomodate the transfer learning by adapting to inception-v3 net weights with total data set as test data.

6.	Analyzing other holistic image classification techniques .
